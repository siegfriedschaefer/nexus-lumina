### Findings

The whole process of scripting, video generation, audio generation and video editing is a mess.
I wish there would exist a more coherent workflow, at the moment there is to much friction to add all parts together.

Video generation with Runway ML depends also of too much probability if the content generated between two scenes is consistent.

Generating crowds of people results in a lot of haluzinations and I think it is totally biased.

Just try to generate something like "crowd of people throwing stones" and you will get almost often islamistic? crowds.
